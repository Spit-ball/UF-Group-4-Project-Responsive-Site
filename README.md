# UF-Group-4-Project-Responsive-Site

## Git History
Changes that were made in Main directly were quick fixes/test fixes meant to be deployed to correct compatibility issues with Github pages. Please do not consider these in the final "Setup" criteria grade.

## Issues
We aren't sure what happened to the Bio page. Additionally, styling for the Gallery page works locally for us, but doesn't show up on Github pages.
